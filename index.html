        <h1>Plan2Wed</h1>
        <p>Do you have big wedding plans?  Or do you remember the big plans you made before you were wed?</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Do your (or did your) wedding plans include "marriage" plans as well?</strong>  It is one thing to prepare for a fabulous, long dreamed about wedding day where every detail is sometimes thought about as if it will actually bring about lifelong happiness, only to be proven to be a momentary and passing dream.  And it is quite another thing to PLAN for marriage.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>How much time and energy will you expend on guest lists and dozens of other wedding day details?</strong>  Often couples who have the most extravagant weddings admit later that the big day passed like a flash and they cannot remember much detail.  It is easy to get caught up in the obligation of greeting all those guests and fail to keep the main thing . . . well, the MAIN THING.  </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Do the reported statistics of divorce rates concern you?</strong>  Far too few couples PLAN for marriage, as studies have revealed it is common for couples to report having spent more hours on wedding plans than in pre-marital counseling or in some sort of pre-marital education/study.  Could this account for the high divorce rates?  It certainly is a significant factor. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Are you looking for guidance in assessing the health of your relationship and learn how to increase the marriage bond after you have made your vows?</strong>  If you are drawing up a pre-nuptial agreement, then you likely will not be interested in the services of Plan2Wed.  But if you believe marriage is a valuable, God-ordained institution that holds the potential to bless those who invest wisely in building a strong, lifelong commitment, it would be an honor to come alongside you and help you PLAN to wed and PLAN to be married for a lifetime.</p>
